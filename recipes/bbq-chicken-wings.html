        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This BBQ sauce is unexplainable. Its not a rich BBQ but not quite a honey BBQ either. You'll love these! </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds frozen chicken wings, thawed </li>
            <li>10 fluid ounces barbeque sauce (such as Kraft® Original) </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple-flavored syrup (such as Mrs. Butterworth's®) </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange wings in a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Mix barbeque sauce and syrup together in a bowl; pour evenly over wings.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven, flipping every 15 to 20 minutes, for 1 hour. Turn on oven's broiler and broil wings until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
